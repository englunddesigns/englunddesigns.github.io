              <strong>Compliance and Anti-financial Crime Resourcing:</strong>
              <br><br>
              We work closely and discreetly with our clients across the regulatory sector and offer retained executive search, 
              contingent recruitment and contractor solutions. 
              We provide our clients with permanent resourcing solutions as well as a flexible solution providing access to a bench of experienced 
              compliance contractors and interim specialists.
              <br><br>
              Our extensive network of regulatory talent allows us to approach some of the best specialists to see if they would be interested in working with our clients.  
              We understand what a client needs from a recruitment partner having been specialising in this since 1998. 
              Our in-depth market intelligence separates us from the many recruitment firms who rely heavily on social media led intelligence. 
              For some of our longer-standing candidates, we have helped them to secure several new roles during their career.
              <br><br>
              We typically focus on assignments which extend from VP to Managing Director levels.  
              Our executive search track record ranges from Global Head appointments to filling key team member roles.  
              Our access to senior talent allows us to also help clients identify potential independent NEDs with regulatory experience. 
              With our network of professionals with extensive regulatory experience we can also assist with the search for expert witnesses.
